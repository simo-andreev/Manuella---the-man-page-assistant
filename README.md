'Tis what it says on the tin. 
  
  This should provide a simple bash + java tool, that grabs the man pages (in what is admitedly somewhat round-about way)  from a Linux distro and an app that can display them in a proper-ish manner on an Android device.

F.A.Q.:

  - But Simmo, wouldn't it be faster to just type 'man' in a cli?
    Yes. Yes, it would be.
    
  - But Simmo, wouldn't it be more informative to google it?
    Yeah, probably.
    
  - Then, by the name of the God  Emperor of Mankind, why bother do this?
    Why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
