'Tis what it says on the tin. 
  
  This should provide a simple bash + java tool, that grabs the man pages (in what is admitedly somewhat round-about way)  from a Linux distro and an app that can display them in a proper-ish manner on an Android device.

F.A.Q.:

  - But Simmo, wouldn't it be faster to just type 'man' in a cli?
    <i>Yes. Yes, it would be.</i>
    
  - But Simmo, wouldn't it be more informative to google it?
    <i>Yeah, probably.</i>
    
  - Then, by the name of the God  Emperor of Mankind, why bother do this?
    <i>Why not</i> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
    
  - What <i>is</i> a 'man page' anyway?
